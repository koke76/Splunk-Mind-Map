# Splunk Interactive Mind Map

This is an **interactive Splunk mind map** designed for SOC analysts, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and anyone working with Splunk.  

During SOC challenges or daily monitoring tasks, itâ€™s easy to get lost with multiple browser tabs searching for Event IDs and example queries. This tool solves that problem by providing a **centralized, clickable reference**.

## Features

- **Event IDs with definitions**: Click on an Event ID to see its description.  
- **Ready-to-use Splunk commands**: Each Event ID shows an example query you can use immediately.  
- **Organized layout**: Commands, Event IDs, and usage tips are color-coded and structured for quick reference.  
- **Interactive**: Drag nodes around, explore the mind map visually.  

## How to Use

1. **Download or clone this repository**.  
2. Open `splunk-mindmap.html` in any modern web browser.  
3. Click on nodes to view definitions and example commands.  
4. Drag and arrange nodes if needed for clarity.

## Why I Made This

As a SOC analyst or when doing challenges on platforms like HackTheBox or CyberDefenders, I often wasted time searching Google for Splunk queries with 100+ tabs open. This mind map helps me **work efficiently and focus on analysis instead of searching**.
